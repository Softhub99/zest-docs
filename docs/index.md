#Zest Framework
Welcome to Zest! Zest is a very light-weight PHP framework without any dependencies except core and autoloader.
# Who is Zest For?
Zest is for PHP developers who want to build apps instead of coding common things like validation, routing, database manipulation, etc, from scratch. Zest offers a set of well-defined toolkits that take care of those things allowing you to focus on building your app.
# The purpose of Zest Framework
As for PHP, there are many PHP frameworks available nowadays, so the question is raised as to why we/people should use ZestFramework. The main purpose of Zest framework is to provide a very lightweight framework without any external dependencies except core and autoloader.
## Zest Framework consists of two dependencies.
#### Core
Core files contains all the necessary files that are required for Zest framework to work properly (e.g., routing, validating, etc).

#### Autoloader
Composer autoloader is used for autoloading files. It's necessary as a means to to load files efficiently. We use Composer autoloader for loading files.

##### Useful info:
The size of Zest core files less then 1MB.
